                                    width="200" height="300">Our old ideas of good
                            leadership is where the leader knows all, tells all and is always in
                            control. In fact, it’s difficult for us to change because those old
                            habits are so hardwired in our brains! Intent-Based Leadership™
                            offers a way for us to rewire: to give control, trust and learn to
                            be okay with not having all the answers. It's a way of leading where
                            the leader sets the environment for others to excel and act to the
                            maximum extent of their creativity and intellect; where team members
                            come to the leader describing what they see, what they think, and
                            what they intend to do. The result: the culture of the organization
                            shifts from one of permission and waiting, to intent and action, and
                            people feel more valued and come to better solutions.</p>
                        <p>Jenni will share the principles of Intent-Based Leadership™ – what it
                            takes to give control and achieve excellence in your organization.
                            This way of leading is the key to successful Agile implementations
                            in companies of all sizes.</p>

                        <p>Most things today are impacted by software, one way of the other. But
                            let’s face it, IT is tricky and it’s easy to get derailed. If we
                            want to succeed with digitalisation, then we need to do it better
                            than any IT project we have done before. We have to start at the
                            procurement stage. And write contracts with clear Effect goals. But
                            how do we do that? In this talk we will walk through the building
                            blocks of Agile contracting and why this is a key to our country’s
                            competitiveness. We will also share case examples, of where it’s
                            being applied and the learnings so far.</p>

                                    <p>How do you build a new business model and ensure cross-organizational deliveries in a startup that sits in a big corporate environment? Especially in an area driving high complexity and consisting of multiple moving parts of different agile maturity and understanding. And how do you go from a department of a big machinery to a stand-alone company without sacrificing deliveries?
                                    </p><p>Agile best practices and methodologies will only get us so far when we are disrupting the core whilst being in it. In order to get the cogwheels turning in the same pace and ensuring nobody drops the ball, we need to create a learning environment, promoting agile mechanisms rather than methodologies. At the same time focusing on actual deliveries rather than delivery practices or ceremonies.
                                    </p><p>We created a delivery engine where we combine both digital and business deliveries to enable all teams involved to work towards the same objectives. Inviting people to shape how we constantly improve our way of working. Adapting each cycle in a pragmatic way, utilizing Scrum or SAFe mechanisms when it makes sense, but constantly ensuring value is added by each new introduction. Never losing focus on delivery, actual outcome, and connection to business value and results.

                                    <p>When members of an organization perceive the workplace as fair, it has a significant positive impact, both economic and psychological.</p>
                                    <p>Research shows that understanding and applying fairness has a tremendous positive impact on an organization and attempting to improve fairness can be very valuable.</p>
                                    <p>Many things in organizations breathe fairness implemented - from salary frameworks, promotion processes, benefits packages to systems and frameworks (i.e like agile, sociocracy, and so on)  how we organize ourselves.  But the basic bit and fundamentals of fairness are often hidden.</p>
                                    <p>Understanding what fairness <i>really</i> is can help organizations a lot, wherever you are in the organization.</p>
                                    <p>This talk will cover the science of fairness, all the way from what it is and actual ways to apply fairness and with quite some precision, to increase fairness in organizations.</p>

                        <h3>    
                            Effective cross-organizational collaboration and decision making using patterns from S3 (Sociocracy 3.0) to harness collective intelligence.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Within agile, we have been extremely successful in optimizing the operational value flow, but the organization itself, its culture, structure, and governance are usually very traditional and not at all agile.
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            S3 is a collection of patterns, designed to create a better collaboration that permeates the entire organization. This leads to increased participation and engagement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will get an insight into how a number of the S3 patterns have been used in several organizations to enable, among other things, increased decentralization, improvement work across the organization and a faster decision-making process. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the most powerful patterns are Driver, Proposal Forming, Consent Decision Making, Role selection, Role effectiveness review, Navigate via tension and many more.

                        <p class="pt-3">These are interesting times, when agile is becoming ever more popular. Agile is
                            adopted by
                            more and more companies, and not just for software development. Many companies invest a
                            great deal of time and money in their agile transformations, and while a some organizations
                            are successful on a level that never happened five years ago, many also fail – some
                            spectacularly.

                            In this session, Henrik Berglund will share his learnings from guiding many agile
                            transformation attempts over ten years. If you want to help your organization towards
                            agility and greatness, you will walk away from this session having learned from Henrik’s
                            experience of some common traps and success factors of agile improvement work.</p>

                        <p class="pt-3">Starting new teams and scaling up innovation is more important than ever. The
                            key to success
                            is applying different practices in different stages of the innovation lifecycle. What works
                            for a new business does not work for a mature one, and vice versa. In this talk, we will
                            nosedive into the major good practices for business leaders and product teams, from the
                            moment they have an innovative idea to the day they will scale it up (or screw it up).
                            Everything depends on the lifecycle stage of the new product or service.</p>
                        <p>With his company Agility Scales, Jurgen is inventing the future of organizational agility.
                            Why are we wasting our time learning how to manage companies, when very soon computers will
                            navigate us through our work-lives and help us to lead and manage our teams?
                            As a serial founder, successful entrepreneur, author and speaker, Jurgen is pioneering
                            management to help creative organizations survive and thrive in the 21st century. He offers
                            concrete games, tools, and practices, so you can introduce better management, with fewer
                            managers. He also offers a platform for you to share your practices and stories with the
                            rest of the world.</p>

                        <p class="pt-3">Though the term “Psychological safety” was first coined (pun intended) in
                            1965, it went mostly unnoticed until the end of the millennium. After Google looked into
                            what makes a hyper effective team and Modern Agile started presenting “safety as
                            prerequisite”, the term has been quite popular in the IT industry; especially in the
                            agile world.</p>
                        <p>But what is it? Why is it important? Is it the same as being brave? Or is
                            that something totally different? Stay tuned for the next episode of… I mean for my talk 🙂
                        </p>
                        <p>Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach, hugger, friend, and much more. She
                            lives and love agile. She took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods when
                            we can use the energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people. Her
                            preferred tools are listening, intuition, and caring. And: the
                            retrospective. Inspecting and adapting is essential.</p>
                        <p>She has a great interest in how people function, courage and
                            vulnerability, how we can feel safe at work, how the brain works, what motivates us, how
                            we can feel better about our selves, how to be perfect in all our imperfections.</p>
                        <p>She is a geek and passionate about a lot 🙂</p>

                        <p class="pt-3">När du inte har något tillstånd för din verksamhet, inga kunder och byggnaden som du
                            arbetar i faller ihop så ger de flesta organisationer upp. Men inte Frälsningsarméns
                            sjukhus i Bandung Indonesien – de bestämde sig för att försöka rädda sjukhuset och
                            jag var glad att kunna hjälpa dem på deras resa.</p>
                        <p>Vem är jag då? En lean/agil coach. En västerlänning med liten eller ingen
                            kunskap om hur man driver ett sjukhus.</p>
                        <p>Vi började tillämpa kanban-principer, och lyckades vända annalkande katastrof till
                            någonting fantastiskt. Det var en total transformation, inte bara av organisationen
                            utan det påverkade också livet för flera av medarbetarna. Medan jag arbetade med
                            sjukhuset, skaffade jag mig insikter i vad principerna i lean och kanban faktiskt
                            betyder, och hur de kan användas för att göra oss mer effektiva. Och även rädda
                            oss från katastrof…</p>

                            constantly surprised by late changes that mess with the schedule and delay the project?

                            project was doomed to failure. We had no clue what we were doing (try testing that!), we
                            had a very tight deadline and no one to work on the project. Can this even succeed?</p>
                        <p>Well, we did. And we did it all without using any estimates whatsoever. How did we do it?

                            och roller. Är en av skaparna av Swenug (Sweden .Net User Group) med över 3000 medlemmar
                            över hela landet. Han började sin IT-resa som speldesigner vid 12 års ålder med sin
                            Amiga. Johan har blivit utsedd till en av Sveriges 10 främst utvecklare av den svenska
                            versionen av Computer Sweden och är skribent för IDG Expert Network. Johan brinner för

                        <p>Året var 2001 då en grupp utvecklare samlades för att summera sina erfarenheter kring
                            lyckade projekt. Det var så det agila manifestet skapades. Bakom detta ingår 12 viktiga
                            principer som man oftast glömmer av att lära ut och inte minst varför de skapade detta
                            manifest. Idag har det agila blivit mer prat om verktyg och processer och inte minst mot
                            just utvecklaravdelningen. Men det agila manifestet är så mycket mer. Johan kommer att
                            prata lite om hur man ständigt kan mäta sin agila resa, hur man skall tänka för att
                            arbete med dessa 12 principer och vikten med att hela företag och inte minst kulturen är

                            agilakontrakt.se. Hon hjälper organisationer och företag att bygga ett agilt mindset,
                            förbättra sättet de arbetar på och leder mot förbättrad innovation, mer produktvärde med
                            kortare ledtider och högre kvalitet med mindre arbete. Med andra ord, precis de saker vi
                            är intresserade av.</p>
                        <p>När kunderna kräver bättre digitala tjänster och produkter behöver företagen hitta nya
                            sätt att organisera sig för att snabbare leverera kundnytta. Gör man inte det riskerar
                            man att bli omsprungen av snabbare konkurrenter. För att lyckas med detta krävs
                            medvetenhet hos ledning och ett strategiskt ledningsbeslut.Den här föreläsningen riktar
                            sig till nyfikna ledare som vill möjliggöra kundfokus och innovation.</p>
                        <p>Mia går igenom trender och nya tankesätt kring hur man organiserar sig och leder arbetet
                            på ett målstyrt sätt för att mobilisera hjärnkraft med korsfunktionella och autonoma
                            team som snabbare kan leverera rätt produkter och tjänster. Mia visar även modeller för

                        <p class="pt-3">De flesta organisationer lider
                            inte brist på innovativa idéer, utan på förmåga att snabbt välja ut de bästa ur mängden.
                            Tack vare ITs frammarsch bland vanliga konsumenter och den snabbt växande
                            mjukvarumarknaden blir detta problem bara större. Innovation och mjukvaruutveckling är
                            redan synonymt i de flesta organisationer. Som Jack Welch säger: Om du inte förflyttar
                            dig lika snabbt som marknaden är du redan död – du har bara inte slutat andas än.Så hur
                            förbättrar vi sättet vi prioriterar på så att vi levererar värde snabbt och inte slösar
                            bort vår begränsade förmåga till innovation? Eftersom ekonomi handlar om begränsningar
                            kan det hjälpa oss att snabbt upptäcka och snabba på leveransen av värde. Detta tal
                            handlar om hur ett Fortune 500-företag tillämpade Cost of Delay på en stor portfölj för
                            att:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Förbättra prioriteringar – genom att använda CD3 (Cost of Delay Divided by Duration)
                            </li>
                            <li>Fatta bättre beslut – genom att göra ekonomiska avvägningar synliga</li>
                            <li>Förändra sitt fokus – från effektivitet och kostnad till snabbhet och värde</li>

                            i produktutvecklingens komplexa miljö gör hon det möjligt för organisationer att

                        <p>Längs vägen har Özlem stött på alla typer av kulturer i organisationer och älskar att
                            hjälpa andra att lära och förbättra sig. Hon delar gärna med sig av sin erfarenhet och
                            talar och leder workshops på internationella konferenser regelbundet. Hon var nyligen en

                        <p>När hon inte reser jorden runt och konsultar, undervisar och talar läser och surfar hon.

                                backloggen, anstränger sig för att förstå krav skrivna för flera månader sedan.
                            Teamet är frustrerat eftersom möten tar så mycket tid från kodning. Det är stressigt,

                            bild som han målar upp av organisationer är nyckeln till framgång redan nu. Men vad är
                            det vi behöver förändra och hur ska vi kunna arbeta med de agila värderingarna i hela
                            organisationen – inte bara på IT?</p>
                        <p>Pia-Maria brinner för att skapa engagerade, presterande medarbetare och lönsamma företag
                            genom agila värderingar. Det är människor som skapar kulturen i företagen och genom att
                            arbeta med bra verktyg, metoder och värderingar, kan vi successivt skapa framtidens
                            framgångsrika organisationer där självstyre och glada människor är självklarheter och
                            bidrar till bättre arbetsliv. Maktkamp, politik och byråkrati skapar lite värde och
                            behöver hållas på en minimal nivå.</p>
                        <p>Med djup erfarenhet från såväl stora, internationella koncerner, som mindre IT-företag
                            och startups, målar Pia-Maria en bild av VARFÖR vi måste strukturera annorlunda och
                            vilka agila värderingar som kan bidra.&nbsp; Hon tar också upp HUR vi alla, oavsett roll
                            eller nivå, rent konkret kan börja göra saker som i förlängningen bidrar till en bättre
                            arbetsvärld.</p>
                        <p>Pia-Maria är grundare och ägare av GreenBullet och specialiserad på Agil HR och Agilt
                            ledarskap. Hon har arbetat som konsult med några av Sveriges största företag men också
                            med mindre IT-företag och start-ups, där hon vävt in agila arbetssätt och värderingar i
                            alla uppdrag. I det agila ramverket har hon hittat värderingar som direkt påverkar och
                            ökar graden av motivation i de flesta människor och huvudfokus har varit att skapa
                            organisationer där människor mår bra och kan prestera optimalt. Som grundare av Agile
                            People (nätverk och årlig konferens) arbetar hon i en organisation som har Sociokrati
                            3.0 som styrmodell och inspirationskälla. Hennes vision är att skapa kundvärde och har
                            roligt på samma gång.</p>

                                har i dag nästan 2000
                                anställda och 30 miljoner betalande prenumeranter. Agile har sedan Spotify
                                startade varit en viktig del i Spotifys organisation och kultur. Var är Spotify
                                i dag och hur hamnade vi här, hur kan man växa och samtidigt värna smidigheten?
                                Peter Antman pratar om bets, alianser, strategisk planering – och framför allt
                                om hur Spotify lyckas förena autonomi och syfte.</p>
                        <p>Peter Antman är agil managementkonsult på Crisp. Under våren har han hjälpt Spotify i
                            San Fransisco att skapa integrerade tillväxtteam. Peter Antman har arbetat med agila
                            transformationer i snart ett decennium.</p>

                        Hur en grupp är organiserad och
                            kommunicerar är en av de mest betydelsefulla aspekterna för strukturen på de
                            lösningar den producerar. Det konstaterade Melvin Conway redan 1967, sambandet
                            populärt känt som Conway’s lag nämns allt oftare. Men vad betyder det egentligen?
                            Och vad har det för implikationer för den moderna teknikorganisationen?</p>
                        <p>Hur får du lära dig varför “arkitekten” och den “agila coachen” är strikt beroende av
                            varandra och varför sakerna vi bygger inte kan separeras från hur vi organiserar oss
                            för att bygga dem.</p>
                        <p>Tobbe debuggar och prestandaoptimerar företag, grupper och mjukvara och brinner för
                            att skapa miljöer där utvecklare kan vara lyckliga och produktiva. Grejjer som han
                            inte kan sluta prata om är Lean, Agile, TDD och mjukvaruutveckling som ett
                            sociotekniskt system.</p>
                        <p>Just nu bär han CTO-hatt på Nepa, föreläser och konsultar lite vid sidan av och

                        <p class="pt-3">Efter
                            att i många år arbetat med och
                            som produktägare i bland annat produktbolag, statliga verksamheter och mediehus, i
                            lokala och distribuerade team så har jag sett rollen tillämpas på olika sätt i olika
                            organisationer.</p>
                        <p>Enligt Scrum är produktägaren en mycket aktiv kravperson inuti teamet, som finns där
                            ständigt tillgänglig för teamet för att svara på alla detaljfrågor och förbereda
                            backlogen men hur ser det ut i verkligheten? Marknads- och dataanalys, affärsutveckling
                            och UX är exempel på uppgifter som aldrig nämndes i Scrum men ofta är en självklar del
                            av jobbet. Kommunikation och relationsbyggande upptar ofta mer av produktägarens
                            tillvaro än att beskriva user stories. Och processledarskap hamnar oftare på
                            produktägarens axlar än man kan tro.</p>
                        <p>Jag berättar om de produktägarorganisationer jag stött på och vad som skiljer dem åt. Och
                            föreslår även en uppsättning av produktägarskapet som jag alltid sett vara
                            framgångsrikt, men ofta är trögt att få acceptans för oavsett hur ”agil” organisationen
                            är.</p>
